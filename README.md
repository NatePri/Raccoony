#Raccoony
A Firefox Addon that adds shiny new features (like automatic downloading) to art sites. 

Currently, the primary feature of Raccoony is to make it very easy to download images 
into nicely organized folders (currently hardcoded to "service/username/filename.ext"), 
and then view the item in the folder after it's downloaded, but there are plans for many
more features. I've captured a few in the issue tracker, and please feel free to suggest
others.

These sites are currently supported:
* Fur Affinity
* InkBunny
* Weasyl
* SoFurry
* deviantArt (coming soon)

The architecture of the addon makes it very easy to code support for more sites, 
so if you see one not on the list, feel free to suggest or write your own plugin
for it. Just look at [one of the *Download.js files](https://github.com/NatePri/Raccoony/blob/master/data/weasylDownload.js) 
to see an example.

##Download
THIS IS CURRENTLY VERY PRE-ALPHA SOFTWARE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
